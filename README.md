# 1. Problem Definition
- Objective: Retrieve, store, and maintain text of all local legal codes in the US related to an input datapoint.
- Languages: Python, MySQL, JavaScript
- Inputs:
   - A string of a single, specific datapoint name (e.g. "sales tax").
   - Examples: Effective Property Tax
- Input validation:
   - Ensure the input is a non-empty string, containing only alphanumeric characters and spaces, maximum 100 characters.
   - Support for non-English inputs (e.g. impuestos, Steuer)
   - Potential for adding a list of datapoints in the future.
Outputs: A MySQL database of all local legal codes in the US related to the input datapoint. The ultimate variable “pg_content” is in plain text.


## Constraints:
1. Data Integrity:
   - Only primary/official sources (e.g. government websites, contracted law repository websites).
   - Publicly accessible online.
   - Text must be archived with a third party (e.g. Internet Archive, Libgen).
2. Scalability:
   - Handle and store millions or more pages of text and associated metadata.
   - Metadata must be sufficient for rigorous academic citation.
   - Extensible beyond local laws if needed.
3. Performance:
   - Complete full retrieval and cleaning cycle monthly.
   - Maximum time for retrieval and cleaning: 14 days.
   - Cost optimization: Minimize cost per character of output text so that the dataset is produced as cheaply as possible.
4. Reliability: 
   - Ensure high dataset size, factual accuracy, and trustworthiness
5. Maintainability: 
   - Design for monthly execution and updates.
   - Extensible to weekly or daily updates if needed.
6. Robustness:
   - Input format agnostic (plaintext, html, pdf, etc.)
   - Rate limiting of scraping and search engine usage.
   - Alert user to unsuccesful data gathering attempts.
7. Output format: Human-readable plaintext.


## Scope:
1. Geographic Coverage:
   - Included: Incorporated communities (local (city, township) and county laws).
   - Excluded: Federal and State-level legal codes, although state-level legal codes may be added in the future.
2. Timeframe
   - Focus on current year's laws (2024)
   - Quarterly updates for significant changes.
   - Historical laws are currently excluded, but support for them may be added in the future. 
3. Language
   - Primary focus on English
   - Other languages are currently ignored unless otherwise specified.
   - Architecture allowing for future multilingual support.
4. Content Completeness
   - Flag and store overlapping or conflicting laws.
   - Flag gaps in data so that they can be found through alternative methods or sources.
5. Data validation:
   - Take random sample of 385 content pages and qualitatively judge them against the raw source documents.
6. Error handling: 
   - Implement a robust system to flag, log, and report errors.
   - Errors include Network, Query, Cleaning, and Validation Errors
7. Legal compliance
   - Respect copyright laws and terms of service. 
   - Follow ethical web scraping practices. 


## Data Integrity and Verification:
   - Checksums for downloaded and processed documents via SHA256 hash.
   - Cross-reference data with multiple sources where possible.
   - Periodic audits via random sampling.
   - Version control system for tracking changes in laws over time.
## Scalability Plans
   - Design database schema to accommodate multiple datapoints.
   - Modular code structure for easy addition of new data sources.
   - Plan for distributed processing capabilities for handling increased load.
## Update Process:
   - Full database refresh: Annually
   - Incremental updates: Monthly checks for significant law changes
   - Version control: Maintain historical versions of laws for tracking changes.
   - Update notifications: Alert system for users when relevant laws are updated by comparing versions gathered over time.

# 4. Algorithms
# 4.1 Search Query Generation
1. Input:
   - Datapoint (e.g. "sales tax")
   - Location information (GNIS id, place name, state code, domain name)
   - Source URL (Municode, American Legal, or General Code, domain name)
- Process:
  1. Sanitize and validate input datapoint.
      - Remove special characters, normalize spacing.
      - Logic for including synonyms or related terms (e.g. sales tax vs sales and use tax) if applicable.
  2. Retrieve location information from 'locations' table in MySQL database.
      - Source URLs are pre-generated using commonly observed patterns.
  3. Construct search query using datapoint, source URL, and location.
      - Optimize each query for Google's search engine as default.
      - Ex: 'site:https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/kingcoveak/latest/kingcove_ak/ "sales tax" OR "sales and use tax"'
  4. Generate query hash for efficient storage and retrieval.
- Output: Formatted search query and associated metadata.

# 4.2 Web Search
- Input:
   - Search queries from Search Query Generation
   - location information (GNIS id, place name, state code, domain name)
   - A specific search engine (e.g. Google Search) or an API for it.
- Process:
   1. Check if a query has already been run within the last year.
   2. If it has not been run in the past year but has been run before, check the number of results it returned.
   3. Run the query through the chosen search engine it was not run in the last year and returned results OR if it hasn't been run before.
   4. Count the number of results.
   5. If the query produced results, save the URLs. Otherwise, just note that it produced no results.
   6. Generate url hash for efficient storage and retrieval.
- Output: Search result URLs and associated metadata (time queried, number of results).

# 4.3 Web Scraping
- Input: Search results URLs
- Process:
   1. Check if URL is already archived.
   2. If not archived or if the archive is not from the current year, submit URL to Internet Archive.
      - Rate limit of 1 URL upload per second.
   3. Retrieve content from Internet Archive.
      - Check if a specific URL path needs to have elements loaded first. If it does, wait for them to load.
      - Rate limit of 1 URL download per second.
   4. Handle different input formats (HTML, PDF, etc.).
      - Directly download HTML, PDF, and doc files.
      - Note other file types (e.g. php, csv, etc.)
   5. Extract raw content.
   6. Store content metadata in 'doc_metadata' table on MySQL database.
   7. Store raw content in 'doc_content' table on MySQL database if it's under a certain size, otherwise stream it in futher steps.
- Output: Raw content and associated metadata.

# 4.4 Content Extraction and Cleaning
- Input: Raw content from various document formats
- Process:
  1. Detect document format.
  2. Extract text using appropriate method for each format.
      - For HTML, process with Beautiful Soup or other HTML processors.
      - For PDF, use Jinja to convert it if it's not flat, otherwise use OCR via Pytesseract, PDFMiner, or vision-capable LLMs.
      - Other formats (e.g., Word, Excel, php) can be converted to HTML for extraction or extracted directly. 
  3. Remove tags, scripts, and other non-content elements.
  4. Normalize text (e.g. consistent spacing and line breaks, character encoding).
  5. Identify and extract relevant sections related to the datapoint via word matching, regex, or LLMs (e.g. BERT, T5, etc.).
  6. Apply any specific cleaning rules for legal text on a case-by-case basis.
- Output: Cleaned and normalized text content.

# 4.5 Update Detection
- Input: Existing content and newly scraped content
- Process:
  1. Compare checksums of existing and new content.
  2. If checksums differ, perform detailed comparison.
  3. Identify added, modified, and deleted sections.
  4. Generate change log.
  5. Update database with new content and change information.
- Output: Updated content, change log, and update notifications.

# 5. Function/method signatures
   - Detailed documentation on functions and method signatures is provided within the source code and will be omitted here for brevity.
   - Sphinx documentation will be generated for the project on final release.

# 6. Error handling
   - Error handling will be handled by Python's built in exception handling mechanisms (try-except blocks, raising, checksums, etc.)
   - Detailed implementation is on a per-function basis and will be omitted here for brevity.

# 7. Testing strategy
   - Linear pipeline, where each module is tested sequentially before integration.
   - Progress is "saved" via uploading output data to the database or outputting to a file (CSV, screenshot, etc.).
   - 100% code coverage will be achieved through unit testing using the pytest library and running the program seqentially through each module.

# 8. Code organization
   - The project is organized based on the modules in 'High-Level Architecture'.
   - Each module has a main class and its own utility functions in the 'utils' directory.
   - Manual subprocesses that only have to be run once have their own directory 'manual'.

# 9. Naming conventions
   1. Python conforms to PEP8 naming conventions.
      - Variables and functions are named use lowercase with underscores.
      - Classes use CamelCase.
      - Constants and global variables use ALL_CAPS.
      - Private variables and methods are named using a single underscore prefix.
      - 3rd party libraries are imported using staandard naming conventions (e.g. import pandas as pd).
      - Utility file namings follow the same conventions as their primary function or class (e.g. AsyncPlaywrightScrapper class is in AsyncPlaywrightScrapper.py)
      - Critical orchestration files are one word, undercase (e.g. database.py)
      - **TODO: Standardization of formats**
   2. MySQL follows standard SQL naming conventions.
      - Tables and input and output variables are named using lowercase with underscores.
      - Commands are written in ALL CAPS.


# 10. External dependencies
   - This project makes extensive use of Pandas, Aiomysql, and Playwright.
   - See requirements.txt for all 3rd party libraries.
   - NOTE: Not all libraries are currently used, and will be culled on final release.
